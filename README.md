# LightGallery image gallery for NodeBB
-----------
Adds [lightGallery](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery) support for beautiful image viewing.  Per the lightGallery GitHub page, lightGallery is:
> A customizable, modular, responsive, lightbox gallery plugin for jQuery.

Goal for this project was simply to enable basic functionality with the default settings.  Currently no functionality exists with this plugin to change any of the default lightGallery settings (ie a NodeBB plugin control panel).

## Installation
1. Install through the NodeBB Admin Panel:
